# GEOS Observing System Simulation Environment

## Purpose

This repository contains general purpose simulators and other OSSE
related software based on GEOS.  This repository is intended for
JEDI-based OSSEs for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP).  While ideas
and concepts are borrowed from the previous GSI-based GOWASP system
developed by Ron Erico and Nikki Prive, this is an entirely independent
code base.
